Author: Hailong Chai [aut]

Description: The solution to some common problems is proposed, 
     as well as a summary of some small functions. In particular, 
     it provides a useful function for some problems in chemistry.
     For example, monoa(), monob() and mono() function can be used 
     to calculate The pH of weak acid/base. 
     The ggpng() function can save the PNG format with transparent background. 
     The period_table() function will show the periodic table. Also the
     show_ruler() function will show the ruler.
     The show_color() function is funny and easier to show colors.
      I also provide the symb() function to generate multiple symbols at once.
     The csv2vcf() function provides an easy method to generate a file.
     The sym2poly() and sym2coef() function can extract coefficients from 
     polynomials.
